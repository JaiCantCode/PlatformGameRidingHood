# Platform Video Game: Little Red Riding Hood
## Descripton
This is a platformer video game I made for my english class. We were tasked to create a re-interpretation of a fairytale in some mode/modailty other than just alphabetic text.

I decided to make a platfomer video game that is a re-interpretation of Little Red Riding Hood. In the game, Little Red Riding hood is a wolf hunter. She chose this line of work after the hunstman saved her from the worlf that attempted to eat her and her grandmother. In the game she is husting hostile wolves in the area(This aspect is currently in progress.)
