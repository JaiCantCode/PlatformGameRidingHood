# Platform Video Game: Little Red Riding Hood
## Descripton
This is a platformer video game I made for my english class. We were tasked to create a re-interpretation of a fairytale in some mode/modailty other than just alphabetic text.

I decided to make a platfomer video game that is a re-interpretation of Little Red Riding Hood. In the game she will be defeating wolves that spawn throughout the stage
